# SystemAnalysis
1. The client wanted a platform to help people study for and schedule their driver’s license exams. The system needed to include features like study materials, scheduling, and progress tracking.
2. I did a good job outlining user needs and translating them into clear system features that matched what the client wanted.
3. I would revise the use cases to add more detail and cover edge cases for a more complete picture.
4. I focused on features like scheduling, reminders, and progress tracking, which were essential to users. It’s important to consider user needs so the system actually helps them and functions well.
5. I start with the big picture and break it into smaller parts using use cases and diagrams. In the future, I’ll also use mockups to help visualize and catch design issues early.
